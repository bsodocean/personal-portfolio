            <p>Hi my name is Valentino, I am a self-taught front-end developer. I like coding, learning new things and technology. On my journey to become a Front-end developer I have created many projects to hone and perfect my skills. In my spare time when I'm not coding, I read, play games, watch anime and go to the gym. I have experience with HTML, CSS/SASS, JS & React.</p>
